# Car Inspection Assistant

This React app helps users evaluate a car's condition and decide whether it's a good purchase. By filling out the pre-inspection form with key car details, the app uses Google Generative AI to provide an automated recommendation along with a detailed analysis of the vehicleâ€™s condition, highlighting positive and negative aspects.

## Features
